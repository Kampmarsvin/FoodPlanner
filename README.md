# FoodPlanner
This is a small application the purpose of which is to suggest seven supper dishes for the coming week. It is not a recipe application, but an application that suggest dishes you already know how to make (or at least dishes I know how to make)
I am still experimenting with this application, so for instance I haven't decided whether ingredient should be an enum. I also use Tasks as return types even though this serves no purpose, but I wanted to play around with Tasks a bit.
Other than that I have tried to use best practices when designing and coding the application.

I will create an iPhone app which does exactly the same, but coded in swift, so it is possible to compare the two languages
