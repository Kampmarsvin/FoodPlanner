# FoodPlanner
This is a small application the purpose of which is to suggest seven supper dishes for the coming week. Once you have seen the seven dishes they will be quarentined so that the same seven dishes won't appear next time.
It is not a recipe application, but an application that suggest dishes you already know how to make (or at least dishes I know how to make)

I am still experimenting with this application, so for instance I haven't decided whether ingredient should be an enum. I also use Tasks as return types even though this serves no purpose, but I wanted to play around with Tasks a bit.
Other than that I have tried to use best practices when designing and coding the application. I started out creating this using TDD. I also made sure that not method is longer than 15 lines, and that every single method only carries out one single job. 

I will create an iPhone app which does exactly the same, but coded in swift, so it is possible to compare the two languages
